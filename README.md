# pgoak

A custom discord bot for our (pokemon-related) friendship group's server.
It is intended to offer a pokemon and raid den lookup database, as well as
some more "meme" commands.

In terms of design goals, I want to be able to show off some of Haskell's
best features to the more programming-minded of them.  For this, it will
be written in a clear, accessible style, but still showcasing intermediate
level features such as transformer stacks, mtl-style typeclasses, and how
generalisation can restrict a function's implementation rather than the
opposite.
